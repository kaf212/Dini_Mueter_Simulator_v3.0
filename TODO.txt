holy shit you just found out what you can do with classes, here's what you need to do:
  - player inventory, achievements, stocks, statistics, everything related to the player belongs into that damn class.
  - write functions INSIDE the class like add_item(), add_achievement(), transact(), add_xp(), EVERYTHING!
  - everything related to dinimueter needs to go INSIDE the class, like randomize_dm_props() and shit
